# todev  
## About the app  
**todev** is a web app for creating tasks and posting them for development.  
Tasks can be posted into the **repo** tasks pane. Each user can create his  
own repo and invite some colleages, friends or anyone else with an account  
on todev to contribute on some projects. Creators of the repo with admin  
priviledges can create tasks. Admins can manage tasks distribution across  
other members of repo by (drag&drop) attaching contriburs to specific tasks.  

## Here is how it looks like

## Why did I make this app?  
I made this mostly for learning purposes. By the time I started doing this,  
I've just been learning **Go**, so I was in need of some actual practice.  
Although the app looks a bit awkward, I'm happy with it. I did learn a lot  
building this app.  
As a reference and source of my project's base, I used Ben Johnson's [WTF Dial](https://github.com/benbjohnson/wtf).  
WTF Dial is a great and well documented project written in **Go** that many  
beginners would find very useful to explore.  

## Conclusion
It was a great experience to build this app. Developing it I learned a lot  
and practiced writing idiomatic Go code, but most importantly I had fun. So,   
my advise to you would be to always explore, learn, spend your time doing great  
work and have fun!
